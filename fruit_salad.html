    <h1>Fruit Salad</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are never leftovers! This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the citrusy sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the longer you can let it soak in its juices. I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve it.

        <strong>Step 1 : </strong>For the sauce: Bring orange juice, lemon juice, brown sugar, orange zest, and lemon zest to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Set aside to cool.
